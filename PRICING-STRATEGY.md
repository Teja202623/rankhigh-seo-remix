## Pricing Psychology

### Why These Price Points Work

**$19/month (BASIC):**
- Psychological: Under $20 threshold
- Competitive: Matches market leaders
- Value: ~$0.63/day = "cost of coffee"
- Annual: $228 is acceptable for small business

**$49/month (PRO):**
- 2.5x BASIC price
- Justifiable with keyword tracking + automation
- Sweet spot for growing stores
- Annual: $588 = reasonable marketing budget

**$149/month (ENTERPRISE):**
- 3x PRO price
- Agency math: Charge clients $99/mo each × 5 = $495/mo
- Profit margin: $346/mo makes sense
- White-label + support justifies premium

### Anchoring Strategy

**App Store Listing:**
```
BASIC       $19/mo
PRO         $49/mo  ← "MOST POPULAR"
ENTERPRISE  $149/mo
```

**Most Popular badge** anchors users to PRO tier, making BASIC seem like "missing features" and ENTERPRISE seem "overkill."

### Trial Strategy

**14-Day Free Trial (BASIC/PRO):**
- No credit card required
- Access to paid features
- Email drip campaign:
  - Day 1: Welcome + quick start
  - Day 3: "See your SEO score"
  - Day 7: "Your report is ready"
  - Day 10: "Trial ending soon"
  - Day 12: "Don't lose your data"

**Conversion Rate Target:** 30% trial → paid

BASIC → PRO:      25% (good upsell rate)
PRO → ENTERPRISE:  5% (niche tier)
Trial → Paid:     30% (with drip campaign)
Monthly Churn:     5% (good for SaaS)

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Considerations

**For FREE/BASIC:**
- Simple architecture
- PostgreSQL sufficient
- No caching needed initially
- Basic queue system (in-memory)

**For PRO:**
- Redis for caching
- Proper job queue (BullMQ)
- Third-party API integrations
- More robust error handling

**For ENTERPRISE:**
- Multi-tenancy architecture
- API rate limiting
- Advanced caching strategies
- Horizontal scaling capability

### Cost Structure

**Fixed Costs:**
- Railway hosting: ~$20/mo (starts free)
- Database: Included with Railway
- Domain: $12/year
- Email service: $10/mo (SendGrid free tier → paid)

**Variable Costs (per customer):**
- BASIC: Minimal (automated scans)
- PRO: ~$5/mo (SerpAPI for keyword tracking)
- ENTERPRISE: ~$10/mo (higher API usage)

**Gross Margin:**
- BASIC: ~75% ($19 - $5 = $14 profit)
- PRO: ~90% ($49 - $5 = $44 profit)
- ENTERPRISE: ~93% ($149 - $10 = $139 profit)

2. **Build BASIC plan essentials** (Week 3-4)
3. **Launch with 2 tiers** (FREE + BASIC)
4. **Gather customer feedback**
5. **Build PRO tier** based on demand
6. **Consider ENTERPRISE** only if agency interest

**Start coding the FREE plan features now!**
